Learn data preprocessing and visualization techniques


we'll use libraries like pandas, for data manipulation 
 matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn for data visualization


 :- Data preprocessing and visualization

Step 1: Data Collection
 For this example, let's assume we have a CSV file named data.csv containing information about sales data, including columns like Date, Sales, and Region.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
In this step, we'll load the data into a pandas DataFrame and perform basic cleaning tasks, such as removing missing values and converting data types.
We'll also create a new column called 'Year' to group data by year.

Step 3: Data Visualization
In this step, we'll use matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations of the data.
We'll explore different types of plots, such as line plots, bar plots, and scatter plots, to understand the trends and patterns in the data.
We'll also use seaborn to create more advanced visualizations, such as heatmaps and pair plots, to gain more insights into the data.
