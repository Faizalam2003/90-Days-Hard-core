# lists and tuples are both used to store collections of items but thet have some differences between them.


# Definition: A list is a collection of items that is ordered and changeable (mutable). Lists allow duplicate values.
# Syntax: Lists are defined using square brackets [].

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

my_list.append(6)

print(my_list)


# so list are ordered and changeable
# and tuples are ordered and immutable (unchabgeable)
# and lists allow duplicate values
# and tuples do not allow duplicate values


# mutable : object that can be chnaged after they are created 
# exmaple list are mutable we can add , remove , or chahge elemnet  
# but tuple are immutable we cannot change them

a = 5
b = "5"
print(a + b)
